The `source-code` directory has code downloaded from [Dive Into Python3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/), and might contain comments/edits.

I also have a directory for each chapter in the book containing code inspired by concepts in the chapter, and notes on things I learned or don't understand from the chapter.
